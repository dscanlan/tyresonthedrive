# Tic Tac Toe
Write a single React application for the game Tic-Tac-Toe.

Your application should all two players, alernating between 'X' and 'O', to place their mark ina 3 by 3 grid. 
When 3 of the same mark are in a line, either horizontially, vertically, or diagonally, your game should display a message for the winner.
The game should also handle illegal moves and tries. At any point, players should be able to start a new game.

Your application should be developed as if you were in a commercial environment. Your application should be suitably structured, 
contain an adequate level of unit testing, and be appropriately styled.

Please take this opportunity to show case any additional skills and knowledge (cypress testing, UI design, typescript ...etc).

The skeleton application has been started with typescript but this can be changed to javascript if you are more comfortable. 
Testing-library has also been added to this project but this can also been changed to a framework that you are more comfortable with.
